# ECDH with go

This client uses ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key exchange to encrypt a file as a secret between two party.

## Set keys

Fill .env to set your private key and the public key of the other party.

Note: the public key needs to be in uncompressed format, and without "0x" prefix. Use getPubKey command to decompress your public key.

## How to use 

set keys in your .env file

build with `go build`

then run `./ecdh-cli` to see available commands

Note : encrypted files contains the first 12 numbers of the recipient public key in their title.
 
### Batch encryption

Create a file with all the uncompressed recipient keys you want to encrypt a message for.
Then run encrypt command with `batch` flag 

## How it works 

ECDH is used to generated a secret key between the two party.
Each party only needs its own private key and the other party private key to generate the secret key.
Moreover, HKDF is used to derive a more secured key from the ECDH generated key.

## ðŸ”§ todo

- use SALT
- encrypt same file for multiple recipient
