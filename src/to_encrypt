## Summary

The ethereum main chain introduced the "Berlin" network upgrade. The same upgrade should be performed on the Q blockchain.

## Rationale

The original rationales from the EIPs are convincing. Also, as the new logic is already implemented in the geth client and has been integrated in the Q-client, this change comes at very low cost.
